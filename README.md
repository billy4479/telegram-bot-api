# Telegram Bot API

This repo is a fork of [aiogram's](https://github.com/aiogram/telegram-bot-api) docker container for the Telegram Bot API.

This fork includes [`botapifm`](https://github.com/billy4479/botapifm),
that, when used correctly,
takes care of deleting uploaded and downloaded files from the container storage.

I made this fork for my other project [telegram-storage](https://github.com/billy4479/telegram-storage).

The original README is available [here](README.orig.md)
